      <h2>The City I Wish To Visit<h2>
      <h3>   Venice Italy  </h3>
      <img  src="images/imageE.jpg" alt="imageE">
      <p>Venice, the capital of the Veneto region, has a population of more than 270,000, according to the latest census (2004). It is located in the north-east of Italy on numerous small islands in the Venetian lagoon. The "City of Bridges", as it is usually called, stretches along the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers. Out of the 270,000 inhabitants, about 62,000 live in the historical center, or city of Venice, about 176,000 live in the mainland or "Terraferma", behind the lagoon, in locations like Mestre and Marghera, and all others live on islands throughout the lagoon (there are about 100 islands around Venice). Also known as a famous place for sweethearts, lovers, artists and poets, Venice is a magical city, which stretches across numerous small islands. It is often refered to as the city of "gondole", which are the means of transportation used to cross the numerous canals passing through the city.

        <h4>Castle Of Good Hope</h4>
        <img id="imageB" src="images/imageB.jpg"alt="imageB" width="150" height="150">
        <p>Built by the Dutch East India Company between 1666 and 1679, the Castle is the oldest existing colonial  building in South Africa. It replaced an older fort called the For de Goede Hoop which was constructed from clay and timber and built by Jan van Riebeeck upon his arrival at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652. Two redoubts, Redoubt Kyckuit (Lookout) and Redoubt Duijnhoop (Duneheap) were built at the mouth of the Salt River in 1654.The purpose of the Dutch settlement in the Cape was to act as a replenishment station for  ships passing the treacherous coast around the Cape on long voyages between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia).    During 1664, tensions between Britain and the Netherlands rose amid rumours of war. That same year, Commander Zacharias Wagenaer, successor to Jan van Riebeeck, was instructed by Commissioner Isbrand Goske to build a pentagonal fortress out of stone. The first stone was laid on 2 January 1666.[5] Work was interrupted frequently because the Dutch East India Company  was reluctant to spend money on the project. On 26 April 1679, the five bastions were named after the main titles of William III of Orange-Nassau: Leerdam to the west, with Buuren, Katzenellenbogen,Nassau, and Oranje clockwise from it.

        <h4>District Six</h4>
        <img src="images/imageD.jpg "alt="DistrictSix" width="250" height="150">
        <p>The area was named in 1867 as the Sixth Municipal District of Cape Town.The area bw after the freeing of the
           slaves in 1833. In 1901 large slum areas were burnt and razed after an outbreak of bubonic plague.New buildings soon arose from the ashes and flourished. The District Six neighbourhood is bounded by Sir Lowry Road on the north, Buitenkant Street to the west, De Waal Drive on the south and Mountain Road to the east. By the turn of the century it was already a lively community made up of former slaves, artisans,merchants and other immigrants, as well as many Malay people brought to South Africa by the Dutch East India Company during its administration of the Cape Colony. It was home to almost a tenth of the city of Cape Town's population, which numbered over 1,700–1,900 families.After World War II, during the earlier part of the apartheid era, District Six was relatively cosmopolitan. Situated within sight of to docks, it was made up largely of coloured residents which included a substantial number of coloured Muslims, called Cape Malays. There were also a number of black Xhosa residents and a smaller numbers of Afrikaners, English-speaking whites, and Indians. Government officials gave four primary reasons for the removals. In accordance with apartheid philosophy, it stated that interracial interaction bred conflict, necessitating the separation of the races. They deemed District Six a slum, fit only for clearance, not rehabilitation. They also portrayed the area as crime-ridden and dangerous; they claimed that the district was a vice den, full of immoral activities like gambling, drinking, and prostitution. Though these were the official reasons, most residents believed that the government sought the land because of its proximity to the city centre, Table Mountain, and the harbour.

        <h4>City Hall</h4>
        <img src="images/imageA.jpg" alt="city hall" width="230" height="150">
         <p>The building was designed as the result of a public competition, the winning architects being Messrs Harry Austin Reid and Frederick George Green, with the contractors being Messrs T. Howard and F. G. Scott. Much of the building material, including fixtures and fittings was imported from Europe. Auditorium with Organ The Organ was built by Messrs Norman and Beard of London and Norwich, the specifications were drawn up by Sir George Martin,  organist of St Paul's Cathedral in London especially for the City Hall. The workmanship and materials are of high quality, and  the organ made from mahogany, teak and pine. Sir George Martin spoke of it as “a magnificent instrument in every gradation of tone,  from the softest stop to the most powerful tuba being found in the organ, and all under the most perfect control, and that altogether the instrument must be regarded as an artistic and mechanical triumph”. There are altogether 3165 pipes varying from 32 feet (10 metres)  to 3⁄4 inch (1illimetres). The wind was supplied by a Kinetic Blower worked by an electric motor. The tower of the City Hall has a Turret Clock which strikes the hours and chimes the Westminster quarters. The faces of the clock are made from 4 skeleton iron dials filled with opal. The clock has a 24-hour wheel and lever. The bells were cast by Messrs John Taylor and Co of Loughborough and the clock was supplied by JB Joyce & Co of Whitchurch. The City Hall's carillon was installed as a World War I war memorial, with 22 additional bells being added in 1925 with the visit of the  Prince of Wales.
